This is the third project I did for the Campus 19 Common Core (part of the international 42 Network). We have to make a basic function that returns the next line from a given text file. 
In the process, we learn about file descriptors, the nitty-gritty of parsing and static variables. 

Allowed functions: free, malloc, read.

Score: 105/100
